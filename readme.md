# jbasic - John's personal basic interpreter

Copyright (c) 1999-2003 by John C. Overton

This was a project to create a simple implementation of the original 1964 
John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth College Basic 
interpreter.

Things got out of hand because, well, it needed more features in it. I soon
found that I needed a scripting language and this fit the bill (although
later, I created scripter as a C-like scripting language).

This version does not support floating point numbers, and so none of the 
mathmatical functions such as ABS, ATN, COS, EXP, INT, LOG, RND, SIN, SQR, 
and TAN are not implemented.

More to come.
